	of the services can be managed using a priority queue. The second
	mechanism enables the system to automatically push the required service
	proxy to the client intelligently based on certain system-related
	conditions. In the third mechanism, we allow the system to automatically
	deliver services based on contextual information. Using a fuzzy-logic-based
	decision making system, the matching service can determine whether
	the service should be automatically delivered utilizing the information
	provided by the service, client, lookup service, and context sensors.
	An application scenario has been implemented to demonstrate the feasibility
	of this distributed service-based robot architecture. The architecture
	is implemented as extensions to the Jini network model.},

	of processing thousands of data sets and storing over 400 Gigabytes
	(GB) of data per day. Over 100 users are supported in a distributed
	system covering eleven geographical areas. The development effort
	spanned two years and involved the integration of over 200 COTS/GOTS
	products. The data that is collected, stored, and disseminated is
	composed of large image file data sets (from 700 MB to three GB per
	data file and associated metadata. Initial customer requirements
	of a two-year retention window and access latency of less than ten
	seconds dictated three-tier storage architecture. At the NASA/IEEE
	Mass Storage Conference TRW will discuss the following: development
	of the prototype in terms of software, hardware, and systems architecture;
	lessons learned from development, integration, and operation; and
	TRW's current initiative, using the lessons learned from the prototype
	effort, for the creation of a laboratory dedicated to furthering
	developments in high performance data storage, processing, and distribution
	systems. System architecture development will be discussed in terms
	of hardware selection across the categories of high performance UNIX
	servers and workstations and high performance robotic libraries.
	The selection of COTS products discussed will include the categories
	of Storage Management Software, database products, system management
	products, and desktop/analysis products. This paper will address
	software that was developed to facilitate integration including:
	software integrating traditional database functions with COTS storage
	management products to provide a multi-tier storage capability satisfying
	customer requirements in terms of performance and cost; system management
	tools used to distribute processing of data sets; and software (glueware)
	integrating numerous desktop analysis and collaboration tools with

	hardware performance in the initial operational environment, system/software
	tuning, the reality of vendor API specifications, and the complexities
	of developing "middleware" in a very heterogeneous hardware/software
	environment. The operational lessons learned address the Lifecycle

	the management of multiple tiers of storage (online, near-line, off-line);
	the difficulties of volume management, media content management,
	and media re-use and the strategies - from original approach to current
	implementation - used to address these issues; and achievement of
	the needed system flexibility (scalability) to handle significant
	extensions and changes of requirements while supporting existing
	operational capabilities. The vision of TRW in Columbia is to create
	a cooperative laboratory environment that supports distributed computing,
	hierarchical storage management, and data distribution. The objective
	of the laboratory is to study and develop high performance system
	architectures to distribute, manage, and process large amounts of
	data for a variety of applications. The laboratory will use the pilot
	program as a baseline to build an infrastructure and delivery system.
	This will facilitate an environment for the development and integration
	of COTS/GOTS components to produce a service based architecture that
	can support many different mission environments. The first step in
	achieving these goals involves the foundation of a laboratory available
	for use by scientists, software developers, vendors, and systems

	factorization and inverse of the generalized mass matrix which immediately
	achieve high computational efficiency. The high efficient SOA algorithm
	is spatially recursive and has a simple math expression and a clear

	linearly with the number of degrees of freedom. Finally, a space
	robot with three degrees of freedom manipulator is simulated in Matematica

	The study presents robot communication model and distributed multi-robot
	monitoring and control software structure based on MMS and web services.
	In particular, monitoring and control software design of MMS concepts
	in web services environment using Unified Modeling Language model
	is discussed in detail. In addition, to verify the validity of the
	proposed design method, a multi-robot prototype system for robot
	flexible assemble cell has been achieved. Its Server software is
	implemented in C+ + with Visual Studio.NET being the development
	environment and Client software is programmed in Java with Borland
	JBuilder 9 being the development tool. Findings - Finds that the
	communication structure following MMS can make the multi-robot monitoring
	and control system have perfect robustness, interoperability and
	reconfigurability. Besides, web services technology can conveniently
	realize MMS services, also can successfully resolve the remote multi-robot
	monitoring and control problem among cross-network, cross-platform
	and heterogeneous systems. Research limitations/implications - Provides
	an easy and low-cost method for realizing heterogeneous multi-robot
	remote driving. The web-based distribution of the presented system
	is critical in enabling capabilities such as e-manufacturing, e-diagnostics
	and e-maintenance. Practical implications - The proposed system can
	be seamlessly integrated into other automated manufacturing systems
	or management systems in plug-and-play fashion. The combination of
	MMS and web services is in favor of real manufacturing equipments
	being embedded in the network, so the presented systematic methodology
	can be a useful reference for constructing web-based reconfigurable
	manufacturing systems. Originality/value - Provides robot communication

	service universally accessible for any customers. We emphasize that
	trans-disciplinary research is essential to overcome these complex

	practical and tense research approaches in which the collaborations
	between biologists and IT engineers and mathematicians are seeking
	the new way to solve this problem, differences in language, knowledge
	base and "culture" between the two groups. Since the medieval times
	the critical leading role of science has been to challenge the entrenched
	conceptions of human reason and to introduce new methods of investigation
	for deeper understanding of nature of things. Once again, a biologist
	and IT engineers are introducing new notion in the trans-disciplinary
	arena from which new generation of intellectual and physical analysis
	and synthesis tools and techniques will be produced. These tools
	and techniques will take the form in which biology, IT engineering
	would be fused into unified trans-disciplinary entities. These developments
	in integrated research would in turn, once again, transform the human
	beyond recognition. Currently, each discipline presents the fundamentals
	of research, frequently by other names and perhaps unknowingly, in

	only be accomplished by an extensive study of the disciplines with

	universal aspects of research have been identified, they must be
	woven into the fabric of the trans-disciplinary research model. The
	transdisciplinary jargon should simultaneously begin to develop during
	this research. We discuss 'humanization and personalization' quoting
	the example of humanoid robotics and finger print authentication
	techniques in which we present the importance of trans-disciplinary
	research to solve these complex problems. We argue the knowledge-sharing

	can be obtained anonymously, while the service provider can verify
	the eligibility of the customer. By periodically performing this
	feedback system, the customer's knowledge, information, suggestions,
	and ideas can be accumulated and the service providers could provide
	more personal services to customers. Once humanization, personalization,
	and feedback mechanism are developed, we could enhance customer's
	convenience and reduce the incidence of operation errors and thereby
	improve their productivity and quality of their service and finally
