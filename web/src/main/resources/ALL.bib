  abstract = {The future Internet is driven by applications that require simultaneous
	access to multiple heterogeneous IT resources interconnected by high-speed
	optical network. Current research on network and IT resource co-allocation
	address advanced reservations in which each resource-type is optimised
	independently. However, emerging applications demand a resource co-allocation
	model that views and optimizes multiple heterogeneous resources in
	a holistic manner. A common platform such as the service plane facilitates
	such a holistically optimised resource allocation model. In this
	paper, we propose a new efficient online algorithm that views heterogeneous
	resource-types in a holistic manner. The proposed service-oriented
	resource allocation model is based on optimised co-scheduling of
	heterogeneous resources owned by different infrastructure providers.
	The optimised co-scheduling algorithm aims to serve a higher number
	of end-users while balancing the load over the multiple resource-types.
	For this purpose, we introduce a weighted scheduling cost that relies
	on the simultaneous identification of available resources of each
	resource-type. The proposed model aims to optimise the efficiency
	and performance from both the end-users' and infrastructure providers'
	point of view. A mathematical formulation in the form of an Integer
	Linear Programming (ILP) is presented to benchmark the performance
	of the algorithm. Simulations are run to confirm the scalability
	of the algorithm. The algorithm is also compared against existing
	resource allocation schemes.},

	We evaluate several state-of-the-art classification methods for their
	accuracy and computational efficiency in this scenario. The studies
	are performed on a data set generated by a TPC-W benchmark instrumented

	service-oriented virtual based at the University of learning environment,
	enabling teachers to create an integrated teaching environment using
	tools that Leeds, Leeds, UK.have been chosen to best meet their academic
	requirements. Design/methodology/approach - This is an implementation
	of a WAFFLE Bus. A microkernel software design pattern is used to
	enable tools to be added and removed from the system. An enterprise
	service bus is used to provide workflow and message transformation
	functionality. Tools are managed through web service interfaces and
	Shibboleth is used to effect interoperability at the web application
	user interface. The initial services for the prototype were chosen
	to implement a simple web service teaching workflow. Findings - First,
	Shibboleth is shown to provide a solution to the virtual learning
	environment tools' interoperability problem. Second, the service-oriented
	virtual learning environment naturally leads to the ability to operate
	with many different types of information channels in and out of the
	system. This leads to a multiplicity of possible types of context-dependent
	user interface. Third, immersive 3D, possibly the most interesting
	interface, will provide a context amenable to even the smallest development
	teams for the introduction of artificial intelligence into teaching.
	Finally, web service workflow is shown to provide a viable option
	for the implementation of learning designs with advantages and disadvantages
	compared to existing approaches. Research limitations/implications
	- Different types of information channels are associated with different
	security problems. It will be important to determine what the best
	ways are of establishing secure channels to student personal learning
	environments. The present web service workflow design tools are of
	the highest quality and usability, but the design process is still
	a job for a specialist. It might be possible, however, to modify
	these open source tools to bring the design process within the grasp
	of non-specialists. Originality/value - The software system presented
	herein represents one possible path leading away from VLE monolithy
	using a service-oriented approach. A new solution to the tools' interoperability
	problem is presented along with a multi-faceted approach to the user
	interface. The enterprise service bus creates a flexible platform
	for the delivery of web service teaching and learning workflows.
	It is posited that the use of an immersive 3D user interface will
	create a context that facilitates the introduction of an artificial
	intelligence layer into the virtual learning environment that can
	serve robot teaching avatars. Â© Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	a software architecture implementing autonomous semantic agents through
	semantic web services, junction-based sensor networks, local- and
	wide-area networking through wire/wireless integrated communication
	infrastructure. It is so construed as to provide (near-) real-time

	to the SOA of Cooperative Labyrinth Discovery Robotics and Traffic
	Management and Information System Projects. This also takes up several
	issues including real-time goal-oriented coordination of semantic
	web services. Especially described are its essential functions crucial
	to aid security applications. A security scenario concerning tracking
	and routing reported, say missing, vehicles is considered and shown
	how to graft it onto TMIS network. Simulation results show promising
	outcomes. Performance of the system in terms of mean response time
	is analytically derived. Simulation and analytical results agree.

	address the industry's need for agile manufacturing systems to be
	highly responsive to market dynamics. Manufacturing systems need
	to be easily and rapidly changeable, but system re-engineering/reconfiguration
	and especially their (re-)programming are manual, work-intensive
	and errorprone procedures. With SOAS, we try to facilitate this by
	giving the systems gradually more self-* capabilities. SOAS eases
	the work of the SOAS designer and engineer when designing such as
	system for a specific product, and supports the work of the SOAS
	operator when supervising the system during production. SOAS represent
	an application domain of ambient intelligence and humanised computing
	which is not frequently considered, but therefore none the less important.
	This article explains how an SOAS produces its own design as the
	result of a self-organising process following the Chemical Abstract

  abstract = {Ongoing miniaturization and power efficiency of mobile devices have
	led to widespread availability of devices that have an increasing
	amount of processing power and storage, and that support multiple
	wireless network interfaces connecting to various auxiliary devices
	and to the Internet. It is now feasible for a mobile device to host
	services and participate in a service discovery network. Roaming
	of a mobile device from one wireless network to another entails nomadic
	characteristics to the hosted services. We denote this class of services
	as nomadic mobile services. This paper discusses the requirements
	for nomadic mobile service provisioning and proposes the mobile service
	platform (MSP) as a supporting infrastructure and middleware which
	extends the service oriented architecture paradigm to the mobile
	device. The MSP design is based on the Jini surrogate architecture
	specification which enables devices that can not directly participate
	in a Jini network to join a Jini network with the aid of a third
	party. MSP consists of an HTTPInterconnect protocol to meet the specifications
	of Jini surrogate architecture and provides a custom set of APIs
	to develop and deploy a nomadic mobile service. This paper also presents
	case studies of MSP enabled services in diverse domains such as healthcare,
	robotics and positioning services. To conclude, we outline the need
	for a context-aware MSP},

  abstract = {Bridge management systems have proved to be of great value for developing
	preservation strategies, understanding life-cycle costs, and analyzing
	the benefits and costs at the alternatives at the project and program
	levels. However, a critical issue in using bridge management systems
	to address broader asset management needs is that an agency must
	integrate results generated from bridge management systems with results
	from other asset management systems in making tradeoff decisions.
	National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Project 20-57
	was undertaken to provide new analytical tools to support asset management.
	The project's research objectives emphasize the need for tools that
	help agencies to make the difficult tradeoff decisions for resource
	allocation while considering both asset preservation concerns as
	well as the broader set of policy objectives (e.g., safety and economic
	development) that must be taken into account when making investments
	in transportation assets. This paper describes a new analytical tool
	developed as part of the project, AssetManager NT. The system works
	with 10- to 20-year simulation results from existing asset management
	systems and allows users to explore the consequences of different
	levels of investment within and across asset classes. AssetManager
	NT is analogous to a data warehouse for simulation results. It provides
	an interpolation engine, together with a set of business intelligence
	data exploration capabilities that operate on these simulation results
	so that program managers can quickly and easily understand the relationship
	between expenditure levels and performance across multiple dimensions.
	Dimensions in AssetManager NT are: time (up to 20 single or multi-year
	periods), asset classes (e.g. pavement and bridges), geographic areas
	(e.g. districts or regions), and network subsets (e.g. based on functional
	class or ownership). For example, the tool can be used to understand
	how bridge and pavement condition on trunkline routes in the urbanized
	portion of a state might be expected to change over the next 10 years
	given different allocations of the budget across these two asset
	classes. Some currently available infrastructure management systems
	provide built-in capabilities to explore simulation results, and
	off-the-shelf commercial asset management solutions are available
	that provide integrated analysis capabilities for multiple asset
	classes. AssetManager NT addresses the needs of agencies wishing
	to stay with existing tool sets and/or leave the door open for future
	implementation of best-of-breed tools that have an appropriate level
	of sophistication for specific asset classes. AssetManager NT does
	not attempt to implement a consistent approach to deterioration modeling,
	treatment selection or optimization across asset classes. Rather,
	the tool serves a single function - investment vs. performance what-if
	analysis. This is in keeping with a modular, service-oriented approach
	to software architecture. It also recognizes that there are typically
	distinct user communities for asset management tools - one concerned
	in more detailed technical aspects of treatment selection and project
	prioritization; the other concerned with higher-level resource allocation
	tradeoffs. Figure 1 presents the key organizing concepts of AssetManager
	NT. Using AssetManager NT involves a three step process: running
	simulations in external tools and creating input files, using (Figure
	Presented) the AssetManager NT preprocessor to create a scenario
	file, and finally, conducting what-if analysis for a given AssetManager
	NT scenario. Companion "robot" tools also were developed to produce
	inputs needed by AssetManager NT from systems such as the American
	Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO)
	Pontis Bridge Management System. AssetManager NT was tested at New
	York and Montana state DOTs. After reviewing the system, staff at
	both agencies observed that AssetManager NT was a useful tool that
	could be used both in the context of periodic long-range infrastructure
	needs analysis (for long range plan updates), as well as for the
	annual program development cycle. Both states have embraced performance-based
	planning and programming, and were therefore very receptive to tools
	that could support their established business processes for making
	budget decisions based on performance tradeoffs. Both of these agencies
	were already analyzing infrastructure investment tradeoffs, but AssetManager
	NT makes this process easier. The testing process highlighted some
	limitations of AssetManager NT. First, for some types of assets -
	notably bridges, expenditures tend to be "lumpy", i.e. there are
	a relatively small number of high cost treatments that must be done
	on an all-or-nothing basis. In this context, performance predictions
	obtained from piecewise linear interpolation may not be realistic
	in certain circumstances. A second limitation is that the tool works
	only with aggregated performance results, and users can not drill
	down to specific projects or assets that underlie these results.
	A new project being launched by the American Association of State
	Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) AASHTOW are program
	will implement the current version of AssetManager NT in ten state
	DOTs and then develop a plan for future enhancement of the tool.
	Enhancements will be determined based on input from the participating
	agencies. Some of these enhancements may address the limitations
	discussed above that were identified in the initial testing process.
	It is likely that changes to the tool's software architecture and
	platform will be made as well - the tool is currently a stand-alone
	desktop application. The AASHTOW are project will also encompass
	a second tool developed in NCHRP Project 20-57 - AssetManager PT,
	which works with a list of proposed projects and addresses shorter
	range tradeoff questions. Integration of the NT and PT tools will
	be explored as one way to address the desire for additional drill-down
	capabilities. &copy; 2006 Taylor &amp; Francis Group.},

	Considering the targets of home alliances are embedded systems, this

	A robust, manageable, distributed infrastructure is absolutely necessary

	provides the capability of supporting message-oriented middleware,
	and event-driven integration, as well as the capability of supporting
	service routing and substitution, protocol transformations, and other

	layers, to be finally available in a suited format and at the right
	place to be accessible by high-level decision-making agents. In this
	sense, the presented approach shows how to abstract away from the
	raw real-world data step by step by means of semantic technologies.
	The paper concludes by demonstrating the benefits of the framework
	in a real scenario. A hardware fault is simulated in a REMUS 100
	AUV while performing a mission. This triggers a knowledge exchange
	between the status monitoring agent and the adaptive mission planner
	embedded agent. By using the proposed framework, both services can

	offered as part of a service. An ontology is used to represent the
	relationships between functional hierarchies in a service. Fuzzy
	clustering is employed to partition service processes into subsets
	for identifying modules in a given service family. The clustering
	result identifies the platform and its modules using a platform level
	membership function. We apply the proposed methodology to determine

	coordination is the key to the required effective cooperation. Coordination
	means that the individual systems Can take actions under local control,
	based on a sufficiently consistent view of the common system environment

	the proposed architecture provides the necessary communication services.
	Secondly, system control must be prepared to cope with a dynamic

  abstract = {Recently TRW fielded a prototype system for a government customer.
	It provides a wide range of capabilities including data collection,
	hierarchical storage, automated distribution, data analysis, and
	product dissemination of imagery information. The system is capable
	of processing thousands of data sets and storing over 400 Gigabytes
	(GB) of data per day. Over 100 users are supported in a distributed
	system covering eleven geographical areas. The development effort
	spanned two years and involved the integration of over 200 COTS/GOTS
	products. The data that is collected, stored, and disseminated is
	composed of large image file data sets (from 700 MB to three GB per
	data file and associated metadata. Initial customer requirements
	of a two-year retention window and access latency of less than ten
	seconds dictated three-tier storage architecture. At the NASA/IEEE
	Mass Storage Conference TRW will discuss the following: development
	of the prototype in terms of software, hardware, and systems architecture;
	lessons learned from development, integration, and operation; and
	TRW's current initiative, using the lessons learned from the prototype
	effort, for the creation of a laboratory dedicated to furthering
	developments in high performance data storage, processing, and distribution
	systems. System architecture development will be discussed in terms
	of hardware selection across the categories of high performance UNIX
	servers and workstations and high performance robotic libraries.
	The selection of COTS products discussed will include the categories
	of Storage Management Software, database products, system management
	products, and desktop/analysis products. This paper will address
	software that was developed to facilitate integration including:
	software integrating traditional database functions with COTS storage
	management products to provide a multi-tier storage capability satisfying
	customer requirements in terms of performance and cost; system management
	tools used to distribute processing of data sets; and software (glueware)
	integrating numerous desktop analysis and collaboration tools with
	the data storage and distribution process. In terms of software and
	hardware integration the paper will address requirements "creep",
	hardware performance in the initial operational environment, system/software
	tuning, the reality of vendor API specifications, and the complexities
	of developing "middleware" in a very heterogeneous hardware/software
	environment. The operational lessons learned address the Lifecycle
	support and administrative complexities of a distributed storage
	and processing system. Issues covered will include the following:
	the management of multiple tiers of storage (online, near-line, off-line);
	the difficulties of volume management, media content management,
	and media re-use and the strategies - from original approach to current
	implementation - used to address these issues; and achievement of
	the needed system flexibility (scalability) to handle significant
	extensions and changes of requirements while supporting existing
	operational capabilities. The vision of TRW in Columbia is to create
	a cooperative laboratory environment that supports distributed computing,
	hierarchical storage management, and data distribution. The objective
	of the laboratory is to study and develop high performance system
	architectures to distribute, manage, and process large amounts of
	data for a variety of applications. The laboratory will use the pilot
	program as a baseline to build an infrastructure and delivery system.
	This will facilitate an environment for the development and integration
	of COTS/GOTS components to produce a service based architecture that
	can support many different mission environments. The first step in
	achieving these goals involves the foundation of a laboratory available
	for use by scientists, software developers, vendors, and systems
	integration engineers. When completed the laboratory will consist
	of hardware and software supplied by the government, vendors, and
	TRW. The environment will allow vendors, software developers, and
	system integrators to demonstrate products and components working
	in an integrated system. Considerable attention will focus on evaluating
	COTS products in the areas of storage management, databases, desktop
	tools, and user applications.},

	from multiple vendors run into interoperability barriers. Systems
	of integrated medical devices support improvements in workflow and
	reductions in medical errors and healthcare costs to the benefit
	of patients throughout the continuum of care. Methods: Interoperability
	is achieved using a middleware for ubiquitous computing based on
	a service-oriented architecture. Connected devices provide services
	that can be composed dynamically to achieve extended functionality.
	We created a dynamic service composition system that generates high-level
	services based on the information the user provides using natural
	language. The system finds required devices based on a type of semantic
	distance between words and device descriptions and establishes connections
	between devices in order to satisfy the request. Results: One application
	of this approach is an intelligent surgical service where the medical
	doctor uses his voice to control a surgery robot. This scenario is
	experimented by asking the system to compose a service according
	to a medical doctor’s request during an appendectomy. Conclusion:
	Combining device functionality in order to satisfy a need expressed
	using a verbal request can be achieved by linking the semantics of
	the request to the computer understanding of a device. Interacting

	existing as well as emerging e-Health services over converged next

	for the class-based QoS concept of the EPS. The proposed mapping
	aims to provide network operators with guidelines for meeting heterogeneous

	algorithm for base fixed robots with the conservation of linear and
	angular momentum theory to establish dynamic equations for the free-floating
	space robot, and analyzes the influence to the base body's position
	and posture when the manipulator is capturing a target. The recursive
	Newton-Euler kinematic equations on screw form for the space robot
	are derived, and the techniques of the sequential filtering and smoothing
	methods in optimal estimation theory are used to derive an innovation
	factorization and inverse of the generalized mass matrix which immediately
	achieve high computational efficiency. The high efficient SOA algorithm
	is spatially recursive and has a simple math expression and a clear
	physical understanding, and its computational complexity grows only
	linearly with the number of degrees of freedom. Finally, a space
	robot with three degrees of freedom manipulator is simulated in Matematica
	6.0. Compared with ADAMS, the simulation reveals that the SOA algorithm
	is much more efficient to solve the forward and inverse dynamic problems.
	As a result, the requirements of real-time simulation for dynamics

	years. With the robot systems leaving the laboratory environment,
	the aspect of wireless communication is getting more important. Especially
	in multi robot systems wireless communication is crucial, but existing
	middleware for robot systems does not regard the challenges of wireless
	communication. Among other aspects the fluctuation of link delay,
	bandwidth and availability is characteristic for wireless communication.
	A communication system in a multi robot system must be capable to
	manage these challenges. Another issue is efficient point to multipoint
	(multicast) communication. This allows the availability of the same
	data to multiple recipients without an unnecessary high increase
	of network load compared to unicast communication schemes.
	
	We therefore propose a multicast communication framework for a multi

	in two parts. The first part is a general framework for a wireless
	multicast communication protocol, which is optimized to offer efficient
	multicast communication capabilities on wireless networks and takes
	the available link qualities into account. The second part is a framework
	for a robot middleware, which benefits from the multicast communication
	optimizations of the first part. The framework assumes unreliable
	communication, thus taking fluctuating link qualities into account.
	Both parts are already implemented on a real system and are used

	software systems, called Property Service architecture. The system
	may contain resources like robots, sensors, and different kinds of
	system services, such as controller units, data storages, or a collective
	model of the environment. This architecture contains several solutions
	and distributed system design methods for developing advanced and
	complex systems. It also provides the possibility to add new resources
	to the system easily and during operation. Each service has a very
	simple generalized interface. This meets the requirements of distributed
	robotic applications, such as remote operation, multi-robot cooperation,
	and the robot's internal operation. The simplicity of the interface
	also provides a possibility to scale down the service even on the
	low-cost, low-performance microcontrollers used in small-sized robots.
	The main features of the architecture are the dynamic properties
	of the resources, automatic reconfiguration, and the high level of
	reusability of the implemented methods and algorithms.},

	The study presents robot communication model and distributed multi-robot
	monitoring and control software structure based on MMS and web services.
	In particular, monitoring and control software design of MMS concepts
	in web services environment using Unified Modeling Language model
	is discussed in detail. In addition, to verify the validity of the

	environment and Client software is programmed in Java with Borland
	JBuilder 9 being the development tool. Findings - Finds that the
	communication structure following MMS can make the multi-robot monitoring
	and control system have perfect robustness, interoperability and
	reconfigurability. Besides, web services technology can conveniently
	realize MMS services, also can successfully resolve the remote multi-robot
	monitoring and control problem among cross-network, cross-platform
	and heterogeneous systems. Research limitations/implications - Provides
	an easy and low-cost method for realizing heterogeneous multi-robot
	remote driving. The web-based distribution of the presented system
	is critical in enabling capabilities such as e-manufacturing, e-diagnostics
	and e-maintenance. Practical implications - The proposed system can
	be seamlessly integrated into other automated manufacturing systems
	or management systems in plug-and-play fashion. The combination of
	MMS and web services is in favor of real manufacturing equipments
	being embedded in the network, so the presented systematic methodology
	can be a useful reference for constructing web-based reconfigurable

	intense machine interaction, knowledge intensive services has become
	an essential requirement issues for the customers. In this speech,
	We discuss wide range of interconnected topics, emphasizing the multi-faced
	nature of service functions. We argue that by proper 'humanization
	and personalization' of interactive system and by the use of teams
	of computer supported professionals, we can provide the knowledge
	service universally accessible for any customers. We emphasize that
	trans-disciplinary research is essential to overcome these complex
	problems. Bio-Informatics and biomedical engineering may be the first
	practical and tense research approaches in which the collaborations
	between biologists and IT engineers and mathematicians are seeking
	the new way to solve this problem, differences in language, knowledge
	base and "culture" between the two groups. Since the medieval times
	the critical leading role of science has been to challenge the entrenched
	conceptions of human reason and to introduce new methods of investigation
	for deeper understanding of nature of things. Once again, a biologist
	and IT engineers are introducing new notion in the trans-disciplinary
	arena from which new generation of intellectual and physical analysis
	and synthesis tools and techniques will be produced. These tools
	and techniques will take the form in which biology, IT engineering
	would be fused into unified trans-disciplinary entities. These developments
	in integrated research would in turn, once again, transform the human
	beyond recognition. Currently, each discipline presents the fundamentals
	of research, frequently by other names and perhaps unknowingly, in
	its own context and jargon. Thus, the difficulty of interdisciplinary
	research, from existing disciplines and synthesize them into the
	foundation of the new trans-discipline. This extraction process can
	only be accomplished by an extensive study of the disciplines with
	the specific goal of identifying the truly common aspects. Once the
	universal aspects of research have been identified, they must be
	woven into the fabric of the trans-disciplinary research model. The
	transdisciplinary jargon should simultaneously begin to develop during
	this research. We discuss 'humanization and personalization' quoting
	the example of humanoid robotics and finger print authentication
	techniques in which we present the importance of trans-disciplinary
	research to solve these complex problems. We argue the knowledge-sharing
	scheme applying the feedback mechanism in which the customer's opinion
	can be obtained anonymously, while the service provider can verify
	the eligibility of the customer. By periodically performing this
	feedback system, the customer's knowledge, information, suggestions,
	and ideas can be accumulated and the service providers could provide
	more personal services to customers. Once humanization, personalization,
	and feedback mechanism are developed, we could enhance customer's
	convenience and reduce the incidence of operation errors and thereby
	improve their productivity and quality of their service and finally
	form a knowledge-sharing infrastructure shown in Figure 1.},

	applications, the effect and efficiency of the remotely sensed image
	processing is far from the user's expectation. The emergence of Service
	Oriented Architecture (SOA) may make this challenge manageable. It
	encapsulate all processing function into services and recombine them
	with service chain. The service composition on demand has become
	a hot topic. Aiming at the success rate, quality and efficiency of
	processing service composition for remote sensing application, a
	remote sensed image processing service composition method is proposed
	in this paper. It composes services for a user requirement through
	two steps: 1) dynamically constructs a complete service dependency
	graph for user requirement on-line; 2) AO* based heuristic searches
	for optimal valid path in service dependency graph. These services
	within the service dependency graph are considered relevant to the
	specific request, instead of overall registered services. The second
	step, heuristic search is a promising approach for automated planning.

  abstract = {The interest in a healthy and happy life for seniors has increased
	of late as the quality of life in old age has become a hot issue.
	Moreover, the interest in health has led industrial companies to
	concentrate on healthcare technology. Healthcare robot technology
	is one of the biggest issues in the robotics field, and many companies
	and institutes have sought to develop a healthcare robot technology.
	The healthcare robot must have certain abilities that would allow
	it to help a person mentally and/or physically. There is no common
	interface module, however, for healthcare robot platforms, and few
	robots that have healthcare abilities exist. Therefore, developing
	a common interface technology and applying the technology to robot
	platforms can pave the way for the development of a technology that
	could improve the physical and mental health of humans. This paper
	introduces the authors' research on a common interface module and
	a healthcare service robot platform. First, a common interface module
	is one that can be used in common in the healthcare robot area. The
	research on a common interface module contains the following technologies:
	biosignal processing modules; voice signal processing modules, which
	could recognize voice commands; control modules for robot actuators;
	and a human-friendly design for a healthcare system. Lastly, the
	research on a healthcare service robot platform contains three types
	of robot platforms: ChairBot for relaxation, RideBot for exercising,
	and LifecareBot for human emotions. Each robot platform has common
	interface modules for healthcare services and can provide specialized
	intelligent services based on their own objectives. In conclusion,

	of Web services based maintenance systems. This paper presents an

  abstract = {The concept of learning objects and their usage just-in-time, at the
	precise moment whenever necessary, adapted to the context, is as
	old as technology-enhanced learning itself: The basic limitation
	of films in education is that the filmed material has not been programmed
	properly into the course of study. Only now, twenty years after the
	advent of the technique, are we beginning to think of eight millimeter,
	cartridge load, single concept films for education. Try to visualize
	two to ten minute segments of films, in self-load, self-thread cartridges,
	on the shelf in every classroom so that students or the teacher can
	display a demonstration of a scientific principle, explanation of
	a theorem, or an event in history, anytime during the class or course,
	simply by selecting the proper cartridge and pushing it into a rear
	screen projector. Such could be the potential of filmed material,
	properly programmed, in the future. [170] This quote, from the very
	first international conference on technology-enhanced learning in
	Germany in 1965 paints a future in which learning objects instantiated
	in video cartridges are "programmed" (the predominant jargon at that
	time of behavioristic learning theories) into the course, selected
	by students or teachers. This vision did not include the automatic
	selection of learning objects, albeit the necessary techniques were
	already under investigation for almost a decade. About ten years
	earlier, in 1956, a conference in Dartmouth gave birth to the field
	"Artificial Intelligence". The aim of describing any feature of intelligence
	so precisely that machines can simulate it [98] today include the
	skill of teaching, resulting in applications that support the student
	in various ways while learning. The work in this book describes teaching
	knowledge required for the automatic assembly of courseware in a
	previously unavailable level of detail. A large set of primitives,
	covering basic functionalities such as searching for learning objects,
	inquiring about the learner's competencies, inserting learning objects,
	and others, are formalized. From these basic building blocks, scenarios
	are assembled that support students in achieving complex learning
	goals. This set of pedagogical knowledge is then integrated into
	a Web-based, service-oriented architecture, in order to make this
	valuable expert knowledge available to others. At the same time,
	this work does not marginalize practical considerations. Thorough
	summative and formative evaluations assessed the acceptance of such
	unfamiliar paradigms by students, and technical evaluations made
	sure that the performance is suited for application in the real-world.
	The idea of inserting learning objects just-in-time in a course is
	thus realized - albeit not based on film cartridges. In the following,
	we will start this chapter by putting the above example into the
	world of today, i.e. the world of digital resources. &copy; 2008

	on Autonomous agents and multiagent systems},
  year = {2007},
  address = {New York, NY, USA},
  publisher = {ACM},
  abstract = {The ubiquity, distribution, and connectedness of contemporary computer
	systems enable them to provide the services that are required by
	our information-rich society, but this has come at the expense of
	a dramatic increase in their size, complexity, and diversity. To
	provide timely services with required quality, the computer systems
	must interact with one another and with humans; and characterizing
	the participants as agents provides a convenient and powerful abstraction
	for designing and understanding the interactions. Agent technologies
	thus play essential roles in the design of complex, distributed,
	and service-oriented systems. The technologies govern the nature
	and character of the interactions, as well as the means by which
	the participants comprehend, coordinate, enable, implement, and cause
	the interactions. The AAMAS 2007 program addresses and advances the
	theory and practice of all these technologies.
	
	Agents and multiagent systems also introduce a paradigm shift in the
	way systems are analyzed, designed, and implemented by conceptualizing
	the system components as autonomous entities. The paradigm shift
	in turn addresses complexity, distribution, and interaction. Concepts
	of agents and multiagent systems are shaping landscapes of basic
	and applied research, including social simulation, games, pervasive
	and ubiquitous computing, robotics, user interfaces, computer-mediated
	collaboration, electronic commerce, information retrieval, education
	and training, and autonomic computing. All of these research areas
	are represented in the AAMAS 2007 program.
	
	The Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS) conference series
	brings together researchers from around the world to share the latest
	advances in the field. It was initiated in 2002 as a merger of three
	highly successful related events: the International Conference on
	Autonomous Agents (AGENTS), the International Conference on Multi-Agent
	Systems (ICMAS), and the International Workshop on Agent Theories,
	Architectures, and Languages (ATAL). The AAMAS conference series
	provides a single, high-profile forum for research in the theory
	and practice of autonomous agents and multiagent systems. AAMAS 2002,
	the first of the series, was held in Bologna, followed by AAMAS 2003
	in Melbourne, AAMAS 2004 in New York, AAMAS 2005 in Utrecht, AAMAS
	2006 in Hakodate, and AAMAS 2007 in Honolulu, Hawai'i.
	
	AAMAS 2007 received 531 submissions for the main conference. Each
	paper was reviewed by at least three program committee members (guided
	by a senior program committee member). 122 papers were accepted as
	full 8-page papers, and an additional 131 were accepted as short
	3-page papers (acceptance rates of 23\% for full papers and 48\%
	overall). Among the most exemplary papers appearing at the conference
	are the papers nominated for the Best Paper and Best Student Paper
	awards, and these are listed below.
	
	The AAMAS 2007 program is organized so that all accepted papers, both
	full length and short, will be presented at poster sessions. Full
	papers will additionally be presented in oral sessions. We consider
	poster presentations as an important form of detailed technical exchange.
	We however believe that oral presentations provide an additional
	means of exchange, which is of particular importance for younger
	researchers.
	
	Besides the main conference program, the five-day AAMAS event consists
	of 8 tutorials, 19 workshops, a main conference track, a separate
	industry paper track with 10 papers, demonstration sessions with
	11 demonstrations, an exhibition, and a doctoral mentoring program
	with 17 students.},

  title = {AAMAS '06: Proceedings of the fifth international joint conference
	on Autonomous agents and multiagent systems},
  year = {2006},
  address = {New York, NY, USA},
  publisher = {ACM},
  abstract = {The spread of Internet connectivity and advancement of computer hardware
	increases the power of information technologies to perform practical
	services in many areas of our everyday life. Agent technologies play
	essential roles in the design of service-oriented systems such as
	computer-mediated collaboration, education and training, electronic
	commerce, information retrieval, and data mining.Agents and multiagent
	systems also provide a new way of thinking--conceptualizing performance
	elements as autonomous changes the paradigm for analyzing problems,
	designing systems, and dealing with complexity, distribution, and
	interactivity. Concept of agents and multiagent architecture are
	shaping landscapes of basic research areas including social simulation,
	games, pervasive and ubiquitous computing, robotics, and user interfaces.The
	Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS) conference series
	brings together researchers from around the world to share the latest
	advances in the field. It was initiated in 2002 as a merger of three
	highly successful related events: the International Conference on
	Autonomous Agents (AGENTS), the International Conference on Multi-Agent
	Systems (ICMAS), and the International Workshop on Agent Theories,
	Architectures, and Languages (ATAL). The AAMAS conference series
	provides a single, high-profile forum for research in the theory
	and practice of autonomous agents and multiagent systems. AAMAS 2002,
	the first of the series, was held in Bologna, followed by AAMAS 2003
	in Melbourne, AAMAS 2004 in New York, and AAMAS 2005 in Utrecht.
	AAMAS 2006 is held in Hakodate, Japan.The five-day event consists
	of 6 tutorials, 32 workshops, a main conference track, a separate
	industry paper track with 15 papers, demonstration sessions with
	17 demonstrations, an exhibition, and a doctoral mentoring program
	with 24 students. These and other conference elements are the result
	of great efforts on the part of many dedicated volunteers. We are
	grateful to all the AAMAS-06 conference officials and those who worked
	with them to put together such a successful research meeting.AAMAS
	2006 received 553 submissions for the main conference. Each paper
	was reviewed by at least three program committee members (guided
	by a senior program committee member). 127 papers were accepted as
	full 8-page papers, and an additional 123 were accepted as short
	3-page papers (acceptance rates of 23.0\% for full papers and 45.2\%
	overall).Several innovations were added to this year's conference
	program and review process. In order to make the review process more
	interactive, authors were given the opportunity to respond to their
	reviews prior to the discussion phase and final decisions. In many
	cases, the reviews, and sometimes the decisions, were altered as
	a result. In addition, we introduced awards for "best program committee
	member" and "best senior program committee member" in recognition
	of the exceptional time and effort contributed by our program committee.At
	the conference itself, for the first time, the emphasis was on poster
	presentations as the main form of technical exchange. All accepted
	papers were presented at poster sessions, with just about half of
	the full papers presented orally in two parallel tracks. The oral
	presentations were chosen primarily so as to provide a broad representative
	of the accepted papers. The goal of this format was to allow for
	more focused oral sessions while maximizing the opportunity for one-on-one
	detailed technical exchanges at the posters.},
