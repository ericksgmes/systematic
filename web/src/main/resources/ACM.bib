  abstract = {The .NET platform is incredibly rich, allowing you to build a variety
	of applications with a multitude of languages. Using a common development
	environment, students can program in languages such as C#, VB, C++,
	F#, and Python, creating software with a range of interfaces (console,
	GUI and web) and functionality (scientific, database, distributed,
	service-oriented, game and robotic). Microsoft's flagship development
	environment, Visual Studio 2008, is freely-available to students
	via Microsoft's DreamSpark program, along with Windows, SQL Server,
	and Expression Studio. These same tools are available for a nominal
	fee to institutional departments through Microsoft's MSDN Academic
	Alliance. If you prefer, you can work outside of Visual Studio with
	command-line compilers, editors, and 3rd-party IDEs, or step off
	the Windows platform entirely and work with .NET on Linux, OS X or
	BSD using Mono.},

	keen perceptual abilities, and service-orientation. People are preferred
	for occupations that require artistry, evaluation, judgment and diplomacy.
	In addition, we found that people will feel more positively toward
	robots doing jobs with people rather than in place of people.},

  abstract = {The United States and its Allied Forces have had tremendous success
	in combat operations. This includes combat in Germany, Japan and
	more recently in Iraq and Afghanistan. However not all of our stabilization
	and reconstruction operations (SARO) have been as successful. Recently
	several studies have been carried out on SARO by National Defense
	University as well as for the Army Science and Technology. One of
	the major conclusions is that we need to plan for SARO while we are
	planning for combat. That is, we cannot start planning for SARO after
	the enemy regime has fallen. In addition, the studies have shown
	that security, power and jobs are key ingredients for success during
	SARO. It is important to give positions to some of the power players
	from the fallen regime provided they are trustworthy. It is critical
	that investments are made to stimulate the local economies. The studies
	have also analyzed the various technologies that are needed for successfully
	carrying out SARO which includes sensors, robotics and information
	management. In this project we will focus on the information management
	component for SARO. As stated in the work by the Naval Postgraduate
	School, we need to determine the social, political and economic relationships
	between the local communities as well as determine who the important
	people are. This work has also identified the 5Ws (Who, When, What,
	Where and Why) and the (H).
	
	To address the key technical challenges for SARO, we are defining
	a Life cycle for SARO and subsequently developing a Temporal Geosocial
	Service Oriented Architecture System (TGSSOA) that utilizes Temporal
	Geosocial Semantic Web (TGS-SW) technologies for managing this lifecycle.
	We are developing techniques for representing temporal geosocial
	information and relationships, integrating such information and relationships,
	querying such information and relationships and finally reasoning
	about such information and relationships so that the commander can
	answer questions related to the 5Ws and H. To our knowledge we believe
	that this is the first attempt to develop TGS-SW technologies as
	well as lifecycle management for SARO.},

  abstract = {Multi robot systems (MRS) have been an active research area for many
	years. With the robot systems leaving the laboratory environment,
	the aspect of wireless communication is getting more important. Especially
	in multi robot systems wireless communication is crucial, but existing
	middleware for robot systems does not regard the challenges of wireless
	communication. Among other aspects the fluctuation of link delay,
	bandwidth and availability is characteristic for wireless communication.
	A communication system in a multi robot system must be capable to
	manage these challenges. Another issue is efficient point to multipoint
	(multicast) communication. This allows the availability of the same
	data to multiple recipients without an unnecessary high increase
	of network load compared to unicast communication schemes.
	
	We therefore propose a multicast communication framework for a multi
	robot system based on wireless communication. The framework is organised
	in two parts. The first part is a general framework for a wireless
	multicast communication protocol, which is optimized to offer efficient
	multicast communication capabilities on wireless networks and takes
	the available link qualities into account. The second part is a framework
	for a robot middleware, which benefits from the multicast communication
	optimizations of the first part. The framework assumes unreliable
	communication, thus taking fluctuating link qualities into account.
	Both parts are already implemented on a real system and are used
	in an experimental multi robot system.},

  title = {AAMAS '07: Proceedings of the 6th international joint conference
	on Autonomous agents and multiagent systems},
  year = {2007},
  address = {New York, NY, USA},
  publisher = {ACM},
  abstract = {The ubiquity, distribution, and connectedness of contemporary computer
	systems enable them to provide the services that are required by
	our information-rich society, but this has come at the expense of
	a dramatic increase in their size, complexity, and diversity. To
	provide timely services with required quality, the computer systems
	must interact with one another and with humans; and characterizing
	the participants as agents provides a convenient and powerful abstraction
	for designing and understanding the interactions. Agent technologies
	thus play essential roles in the design of complex, distributed,
	and service-oriented systems. The technologies govern the nature
	and character of the interactions, as well as the means by which
	the participants comprehend, coordinate, enable, implement, and cause
	the interactions. The AAMAS 2007 program addresses and advances the
	theory and practice of all these technologies.
	
	Agents and multiagent systems also introduce a paradigm shift in the
	way systems are analyzed, designed, and implemented by conceptualizing
	the system components as autonomous entities. The paradigm shift
	in turn addresses complexity, distribution, and interaction. Concepts
	of agents and multiagent systems are shaping landscapes of basic
	and applied research, including social simulation, games, pervasive
	and ubiquitous computing, robotics, user interfaces, computer-mediated
	collaboration, electronic commerce, information retrieval, education
	and training, and autonomic computing. All of these research areas
	are represented in the AAMAS 2007 program.
	
	The Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS) conference series
	brings together researchers from around the world to share the latest
	advances in the field. It was initiated in 2002 as a merger of three
	highly successful related events: the International Conference on
	Autonomous Agents (AGENTS), the International Conference on Multi-Agent
	Systems (ICMAS), and the International Workshop on Agent Theories,
	Architectures, and Languages (ATAL). The AAMAS conference series
	provides a single, high-profile forum for research in the theory
	and practice of autonomous agents and multiagent systems. AAMAS 2002,
	the first of the series, was held in Bologna, followed by AAMAS 2003
	in Melbourne, AAMAS 2004 in New York, AAMAS 2005 in Utrecht, AAMAS
	2006 in Hakodate, and AAMAS 2007 in Honolulu, Hawai'i.
	
	AAMAS 2007 received 531 submissions for the main conference. Each
	paper was reviewed by at least three program committee members (guided
	by a senior program committee member). 122 papers were accepted as
	full 8-page papers, and an additional 131 were accepted as short
	3-page papers (acceptance rates of 23\% for full papers and 48\%
	overall). Among the most exemplary papers appearing at the conference
	are the papers nominated for the Best Paper and Best Student Paper
	awards, and these are listed below.
	
	The AAMAS 2007 program is organized so that all accepted papers, both
	full length and short, will be presented at poster sessions. Full
	papers will additionally be presented in oral sessions. We consider
	poster presentations as an important form of detailed technical exchange.
	We however believe that oral presentations provide an additional
	means of exchange, which is of particular importance for younger
	researchers.
	
	Besides the main conference program, the five-day AAMAS event consists
	of 8 tutorials, 19 workshops, a main conference track, a separate
	industry paper track with 10 papers, demonstration sessions with
	11 demonstrations, an exhibition, and a doctoral mentoring program
	with 17 students.},
