  abstract = {SENORA is an open hardware and software architecture for the cooperative
	coordination of multiple heterogeneous mobile robots operating in
	a common environment. It is designed to meet the stringent requirements
	of modern loosely coupled multirobot architectures, such as flexibility,
	reliability, and fault tolerance. As such, the proposed architecture
	enables the robots to cope with the ubiquitous presence of various
	types of uncertainties in their operating environments. SENORA is
	a fully autonomous and scalable sensory-based peer-to-peer (P2P)
	framework. It also offers a real-time inter-robot communication protocol
	and it is based on the state-of-the-art P2P technology, which is
	specifically designed to satisfy the requirements of physical sensory
	data publishing and fusion. This architecture is implemented and
	evaluated on a team of indoor mobile robots. The test results manifest
	the architecture's distinguished features and capabilities. &copy;

  abstract = {The future Internet is driven by applications that require simultaneous
	access to multiple heterogeneous IT resources interconnected by high-speed
	optical network. Current research on network and IT resource co-allocation
	address advanced reservations in which each resource-type is optimised
	independently. However, emerging applications demand a resource co-allocation
	model that views and optimizes multiple heterogeneous resources in
	a holistic manner. A common platform such as the service plane facilitates
	such a holistically optimised resource allocation model. In this
	paper, we propose a new efficient online algorithm that views heterogeneous
	resource-types in a holistic manner. The proposed service-oriented
	resource allocation model is based on optimised co-scheduling of
	heterogeneous resources owned by different infrastructure providers.
	The optimised co-scheduling algorithm aims to serve a higher number
	of end-users while balancing the load over the multiple resource-types.
	For this purpose, we introduce a weighted scheduling cost that relies
	on the simultaneous identification of available resources of each
	resource-type. The proposed model aims to optimise the efficiency
	and performance from both the end-users' and infrastructure providers'
	point of view. A mathematical formulation in the form of an Integer
	Linear Programming (ILP) is presented to benchmark the performance
	of the algorithm. Simulations are run to confirm the scalability
	of the algorithm. The algorithm is also compared against existing
	resource allocation schemes.},

	and modeling of performance degradation in SOA applications, particularly
	application servers. This method works for a large class of the aging
	processes caused by resource depletion (e.g. memory leaks). It can
	be deployed non-intrusively in a production environment, under arbitrary
	service request distributions. Based on this schema we investigate
	in the second part of the paper how machine learning (classification)
	algorithms can be used for proactive detection of performance degradation
	or sudden drops caused by aging. We leverage the predictive power
	of these algorithms with several techniques to make the measurement-based
	aging models more adaptive and more robust against transient failures.
	We evaluate several state-of-the-art classification methods for their
	accuracy and computational efficiency in this scenario. The studies
	are performed on a data set generated by a TPC-W benchmark instrumented
	with a memory leak injector. The results show that the probing method
	yields accurate aging models with low overhead and the machine learning
	approach gives statistically significant short-term predictions of
	degrading application performance. Both approaches can be used directly
	to fight aging via adaptive software rejuvenation (restart of the
	application), for operator alerting, or for short-term capacity planning.

	highly responsive to market dynamics. Manufacturing systems need
	to be easily and rapidly changeable, but system re-engineering/reconfiguration
	and especially their (re-)programming are manual, work-intensive
	and errorprone procedures. With SOAS, we try to facilitate this by
	giving the systems gradually more self-* capabilities. SOAS eases
	the work of the SOAS designer and engineer when designing such as
	system for a specific product, and supports the work of the SOAS
	operator when supervising the system during production. SOAS represent
	an application domain of ambient intelligence and humanised computing
	which is not frequently considered, but therefore none the less important.
	This article explains how an SOAS produces its own design as the
	result of a self-organising process following the Chemical Abstract
	Machine (CHAM) paradigm: industrial robots self-assemble according
	to specific chemical rules in response to a product order. This paper
	reports on SOAS in general, the specification of the chemical reactions

  abstract = {Bridge management systems have proved to be of great value for developing
	preservation strategies, understanding life-cycle costs, and analyzing
	the benefits and costs at the alternatives at the project and program
	levels. However, a critical issue in using bridge management systems
	to address broader asset management needs is that an agency must
	integrate results generated from bridge management systems with results
	from other asset management systems in making tradeoff decisions.
	National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Project 20-57
	was undertaken to provide new analytical tools to support asset management.
	The project's research objectives emphasize the need for tools that
	help agencies to make the difficult tradeoff decisions for resource
	allocation while considering both asset preservation concerns as
	well as the broader set of policy objectives (e.g., safety and economic
	development) that must be taken into account when making investments
	in transportation assets. This paper describes a new analytical tool
	developed as part of the project, AssetManager NT. The system works
	with 10- to 20-year simulation results from existing asset management
	systems and allows users to explore the consequences of different
	levels of investment within and across asset classes. AssetManager
	NT is analogous to a data warehouse for simulation results. It provides
	an interpolation engine, together with a set of business intelligence
	data exploration capabilities that operate on these simulation results
	so that program managers can quickly and easily understand the relationship
	between expenditure levels and performance across multiple dimensions.
	Dimensions in AssetManager NT are: time (up to 20 single or multi-year
	periods), asset classes (e.g. pavement and bridges), geographic areas
	(e.g. districts or regions), and network subsets (e.g. based on functional
	class or ownership). For example, the tool can be used to understand
	how bridge and pavement condition on trunkline routes in the urbanized
	portion of a state might be expected to change over the next 10 years
	given different allocations of the budget across these two asset
	classes. Some currently available infrastructure management systems
	provide built-in capabilities to explore simulation results, and
	off-the-shelf commercial asset management solutions are available
	that provide integrated analysis capabilities for multiple asset
	classes. AssetManager NT addresses the needs of agencies wishing
	to stay with existing tool sets and/or leave the door open for future
	implementation of best-of-breed tools that have an appropriate level
	of sophistication for specific asset classes. AssetManager NT does
	not attempt to implement a consistent approach to deterioration modeling,
	treatment selection or optimization across asset classes. Rather,
	the tool serves a single function - investment vs. performance what-if
	analysis. This is in keeping with a modular, service-oriented approach
	to software architecture. It also recognizes that there are typically
	distinct user communities for asset management tools - one concerned
	in more detailed technical aspects of treatment selection and project
	prioritization; the other concerned with higher-level resource allocation
	tradeoffs. Figure 1 presents the key organizing concepts of AssetManager
	NT. Using AssetManager NT involves a three step process: running
	simulations in external tools and creating input files, using (Figure
	Presented) the AssetManager NT preprocessor to create a scenario
	file, and finally, conducting what-if analysis for a given AssetManager
	NT scenario. Companion "robot" tools also were developed to produce
	inputs needed by AssetManager NT from systems such as the American
	Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO)
	Pontis Bridge Management System. AssetManager NT was tested at New
	York and Montana state DOTs. After reviewing the system, staff at
	both agencies observed that AssetManager NT was a useful tool that
	could be used both in the context of periodic long-range infrastructure
	needs analysis (for long range plan updates), as well as for the
	annual program development cycle. Both states have embraced performance-based
	planning and programming, and were therefore very receptive to tools
	that could support their established business processes for making
	budget decisions based on performance tradeoffs. Both of these agencies
	were already analyzing infrastructure investment tradeoffs, but AssetManager
	NT makes this process easier. The testing process highlighted some
	limitations of AssetManager NT. First, for some types of assets -
	notably bridges, expenditures tend to be "lumpy", i.e. there are
	a relatively small number of high cost treatments that must be done
	on an all-or-nothing basis. In this context, performance predictions
	obtained from piecewise linear interpolation may not be realistic
	in certain circumstances. A second limitation is that the tool works
	only with aggregated performance results, and users can not drill
	down to specific projects or assets that underlie these results.
	A new project being launched by the American Association of State
	Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) AASHTOW are program
	will implement the current version of AssetManager NT in ten state
	DOTs and then develop a plan for future enhancement of the tool.
	Enhancements will be determined based on input from the participating
	agencies. Some of these enhancements may address the limitations
	discussed above that were identified in the initial testing process.
	It is likely that changes to the tool's software architecture and
	platform will be made as well - the tool is currently a stand-alone
	desktop application. The AASHTOW are project will also encompass
	a second tool developed in NCHRP Project 20-57 - AssetManager PT,
	which works with a list of proposed projects and addresses shorter
	range tradeoff questions. Integration of the NT and PT tools will
	be explored as one way to address the desire for additional drill-down
	capabilities. &copy; 2006 Taylor &amp; Francis Group.},

	the web. Automatic composition of web services is necessary and challenging
	when there are a huge growing number of available web services but
	no single service offers the desired function. This paper presents
	an approach to automatically combining published web services to
	meet the application requirements using as few services as possible.
	Our approach is based on heuristic algorithms that incorporate semantics
	of services from their ontology into identifying valid executable
	services in the composition structure. The paper describes the approach
	and evaluates its performance on public service repositories. Our
	experimental results show correct optimized solutions 100% of the
	time, with a reduction in the average running time, compared to champion
	of Web service challenge' 06 competition, of 60.2% over 31 composition
	problems. &copy;2009 IEEE.},

	and situation awareness of the embedded service-oriented agents for
	autonomous platforms. The results obtained specifically affect the
	mission flexibility, robustness, and autonomy. The presented framework
	makes use of the idea that heterogeneous real-world data of very
	different type must be processed by (and run through) several different
	layers, to be finally available in a suited format and at the right
	place to be accessible by high-level decision-making agents. In this
	sense, the presented approach shows how to abstract away from the
	raw real-world data step by step by means of semantic technologies.
	The paper concludes by demonstrating the benefits of the framework
	in a real scenario. A hardware fault is simulated in a REMUS 100
	AUV while performing a mission. This triggers a knowledge exchange
	between the status monitoring agent and the adaptive mission planner
	embedded agent. By using the proposed framework, both services can
	interchange information while remaining domain independent during

	and unique modules in a service family by integrating service-based
	process analysis, ontologies, and data mining. A function-process
	matrix and a service process model are investigated to define the

	offered as part of a service. An ontology is used to represent the
	relationships between functional hierarchies in a service. Fuzzy
	clustering is employed to partition service processes into subsets
	for identifying modules in a given service family. The clustering
	result identifies the platform and its modules using a platform level
	membership function. We apply the proposed methodology to determine
	a new platform using a case study involving a family of banking services.

	First, the architecture has to resolve the conflict between the autonomy

	coordination is the key to the required effective cooperation. Coordination
	means that the individual systems Can take actions under local control,
	based on a sufficiently consistent view of the common system environment
	and on the application of a set of common rules. To enable this,
	the proposed architecture provides the necessary communication services.
	Secondly, system control must be prepared to cope with a dynamic

  abstract = {This paper proposes a semantic world model framework for hierarchical
	distributed representation of knowledge in autonomous underwater
	systems. This framework aims to provide a more capable and holistic
	system, involving semantic interoperability among all involved information
	sources. This will enhance interoperability, independence of operation,
	and situation awareness of the embedded service-oriented agents for
	autonomous platforms. The results obtained specifically impact on
	mission flexibility, robustness and autonomy. The presented framework
	makes use of the idea that heterogeneous real-world data of very
	different types must be processed by (and run through) several different
	layers, to be finally available in a suited format and at the right
	place to be accessible by high-level decision making agents. In this
	sense, the presented approach shows how to abstract away from the
	raw real-world data step by step by means of semantic technologies.
	The paper concludes by demonstrating the benefits of the framework
	in a real scenario. A hardware fault is simulated in a REMUS 100
	AUV while performing a mission. This triggers a knowledge exchange
	between the incipient fault diagnosis agent and the adaptive mission
	planner embedded agent. By using the proposed framework, both services
	can interchange information while remaining domain independent during
	their interaction with the platform. The results of this paper are
	readily applicable to land and air robotics. &copy; 2008 IEEE.},

	from multiple vendors run into interoperability barriers. Systems
	of integrated medical devices support improvements in workflow and
	reductions in medical errors and healthcare costs to the benefit
	of patients throughout the continuum of care. Methods: Interoperability
	is achieved using a middleware for ubiquitous computing based on
	a service-oriented architecture. Connected devices provide services
	that can be composed dynamically to achieve extended functionality.
	We created a dynamic service composition system that generates high-level
	services based on the information the user provides using natural
	language. The system finds required devices based on a type of semantic
	distance between words and device descriptions and establishes connections
	between devices in order to satisfy the request. Results: One application
	of this approach is an intelligent surgical service where the medical
	doctor uses his voice to control a surgery robot. This scenario is
	experimented by asking the system to compose a service according
	to a medical doctor's request during an appendectomy. Conclusion:
	Combining device functionality in order to satisfy a need expressed
	using a verbal request can be achieved by linking the semantics of
	the request to the computer understanding of a device. Interacting
	with medical equipment through the services they provide as plug-and-play
	devices is not limited to service composition, but also allows prototyping
	and simulation of various medical scenarios. &copy; 2009 Springer.},

	several studies have been carried out on SARO by National Defense
	University as well as for the Army Science and Technology. One of
	the major conclusions is that we need to plan for SARO while we are
	planning for combat. That is, we cannot start planning for SARO after
	the enemy regime has fallen. In addition, the studies have shown
	that security, power and jobs are key ingredients for success during
	SARO. It is important to give positions to some of the power players
	from the fallen regime provided they are trustworthy. It is critical
	that investments are made to stimulate the local economies. The studies
	have also analyzed the various technologies that are needed for successfully
	carrying out SARO which includes sensors, robotics and information
	management. In this project we will focus on the information management
	component for SARO. As stated in the work by the Naval Postgraduate
	School, we need to determine the social, political and economic relationships
	between the local communities as well as determine who the important
	people are. This work has also identified the 5Ws (Who, When, What,
	Where and Why) and the (H). To address the key technical challenges
	for SARO, we are defining a Life cycle for SARO and subsequently
	developing a Temporal Geosocial Service Oriented Architecture System
	(TGSSOA) that utilizes Temporal Geosocial Semantic Web (TGS-SW) technologies
	for managing this lifecycle. We are developing techniques for representing
	temporal geosocial information and relationships, integrating such
	information and relationships, querying such information and relationships
	and finally reasoning about such information and relationships so
	that the commander can answer questions related to the 5Ws and H.

	modeling algorithms is difficult to meet the requirements of real-time

	algorithm for base fixed robots with the conservation of linear and
	angular momentum theory to establish dynamic equations for the free-floating
	space robot, and analyzes the influence to the base body's position
	and posture when the manipulator is capturing a target. The recursive
	Newton-Euler kinematic equations on screw form for the space robot
	are derived, and the techniques of the sequential filtering and smoothing
	methods in optimal estimation theory are used to derive an innovation
	factorization and inverse of the generalized mass matrix which immediately
	achieve high computational efficiency. The high efficient SOA algorithm
	is spatially recursive and has a simple math expression and a clear
	physical understanding, and its computational complexity grows only
	linearly with the number of degrees of freedom. Finally, a space
	robot with three degrees of freedom manipulator is simulated in Matematica
	6.0. Compared with ADAMS, the simulation reveals that the SOA algorithm

	As a result, the requirements of real-time simulation for dynamics

	for software development in many areas, including e-business, robotics,

	behind is the education. In spite of significant progress in SOC
	applications, SOC education has not been taught in introductory classes.
	Existing SOC courses are graduate or senior-level courses in universities
	that require full programming background. While various issues regarding
	SOC are being explored and discussed, the issues for SOC education,
	especially at high school level, still remain uncultivated, which
	does not match up with the importance of SOC paradigm. Sponsored

	High School, we pioneered the first SOC course for high school students

	has become important because of current trends towards software systems

	propose an autonomic architecture that consists of monitoring, diagnosis,

	To solve this problem, the modularization of robots and robot middleware
	has been proposed. From the perspective of modularization, interoperability,
	scalability and ease-of-use, this paper proposes a loose-coupled,
	service-oriented modular robot middleware (MoRoM) architecture. In
	this architecture, we define the standard interface to encapsulate
	services each functional component provides, realize system automatic
	configuration (Plug and Play), and provide a message notification
	mechanism as well as program frameworks. To verify the proposed middleware,
	we implement it using ACE-TAO, which is a real-time CORBA implementation,
	and test it in a modular robot system. The test shows that this architecture

	multi-robot system based on manufacturing message specification (MMS)
	and new-generation distributed object technology - web services for
	realizing remotely monitoring and controlling multiple heterogeneous
	robots in the internet environment. Design/methodology/approach -
	The study presents robot communication model and distributed multi-robot
	monitoring and control software structure based on MMS and web services.
	In particular, monitoring and control software design of MMS concepts
	in web services environment using Unified Modeling Language model
	is discussed in detail. In addition, to verify the validity of the
	proposed design method, a multi-robot prototype system for robot
	flexible assemble cell has been achieved. Its Server software is
	implemented in C++ with Visual Studio.NET being the development environment
	and Client software is programmed in Java with Borland JBuilder 9
	being the development tool. Findings - Finds that the communication
	structure following MMS can make the multi-robot monitoring and control
	system have perfect robustness, interoperability and reconfigurability.
	Besides, web services technology can conveniently realize MMS services,
	also can successfully resolve the remote multi-robot monitoring and
	control problem among cross-network, cross-platform and heterogeneous
	systems. Research limitations/implications - Provides an easy and
	low-cost method for realizing heterogeneous multi-robot remote driving.
	The web-based distribution of the presented system is critical in
	enabling capabilities such as e-manufacturing, e-diagnostics and
	e-maintenance. Practical implications - The proposed system can be
	seamlessly integrated into other automated manufacturing systems
	or management systems in plug-and-play fashion. The combination of
	MMS and web services is in favor of real manufacturing equipments
	being embedded in the network, so the presented systematic methodology
	can be a useful reference for constructing web-based reconfigurable
	manufacturing systems. Originality/value - Provides robot communication
	model based on MMS and web services and presents service-oriented
	distributed remote multi-robot monitoring and control software architecture.

	and multi-sensor, it has been widely recognized for contributing
	to geospatial information efforts. Because the remotely sensed image
	processing demands large-scale, collaborative processing and massive
	storage capabilities to satisfy the increasing demands of various
	applications, the effect and efficiency of the remotely sensed image
	processing is far from the user's expectation. The emergence of Service
	Oriented Architecture (SOA) may make this challenge manageable. It
	encapsulate all processing function into services and recombine them
	with service chain. The service composition on demand has become
	a hot topic. Aiming at the success rate, quality and efficiency of
	processing service composition for remote sensing application, a
	remote sensed image processing service composition method is proposed
	in this paper. It composes services for a user requirement through
	two steps: 1) dynamically constructs a complete service dependency
	graph for user requirement on-line; 2) AO* based heuristic searches
	for optimal valid path in service dependency graph. These services
	within the service dependency graph are considered relevant to the
	specific request, instead of overall registered services. The second
	step, heuristic search is a promising approach for automated planning.
	Starting with the initial state, AO* uses a heuristic function to
	select states until the user requirement is reached. Experimental
	results show that this method has a good performance even the repository

  abstract = {The concept of learning objects and their usage just-in-time, at the
	precise moment whenever necessary, adapted to the context, is as
	old as technology-enhanced learning itself: The basic limitation
	of films in education is that the filmed material has not been programmed
	properly into the course of study. Only now, twenty years after the
	advent of the technique, are we beginning to think of eight millimeter,
	cartridge load, single concept films for education. Try to visualize
	two to ten minute segments of films, in self-load, self-thread cartridges,
	on the shelf in every classroom so that students or the teacher can
	display a demonstration of a scientific principle, explanation of
	a theorem, or an event in history, anytime during the class or course,
	simply by selecting the proper cartridge and pushing it into a rear
	screen projector. Such could be the potential of filmed material,
	properly programmed, in the future. [170] This quote, from the very
	first international conference on technology-enhanced learning in
	Germany in 1965 paints a future in which learning objects instantiated
	in video cartridges are "programmed" (the predominant jargon at that
	time of behavioristic learning theories) into the course, selected
	by students or teachers. This vision did not include the automatic
	selection of learning objects, albeit the necessary techniques were
	already under investigation for almost a decade. About ten years
	earlier, in 1956, a conference in Dartmouth gave birth to the field
	"Artificial Intelligence". The aim of describing any feature of intelligence
	so precisely that machines can simulate it [98] today include the
	skill of teaching, resulting in applications that support the student
	in various ways while learning. The work in this book describes teaching
	knowledge required for the automatic assembly of courseware in a
	previously unavailable level of detail. A large set of primitives,
	covering basic functionalities such as searching for learning objects,
	inquiring about the learner's competencies, inserting learning objects,
	and others, are formalized. From these basic building blocks, scenarios
	are assembled that support students in achieving complex learning
	goals. This set of pedagogical knowledge is then integrated into
	a Web-based, service-oriented architecture, in order to make this
	valuable expert knowledge available to others. At the same time,
	this work does not marginalize practical considerations. Thorough
	summative and formative evaluations assessed the acceptance of such
	unfamiliar paradigms by students, and technical evaluations made
	sure that the performance is suited for application in the real-world.
	The idea of inserting learning objects just-in-time in a course is
	thus realized - albeit not based on film cartridges. In the following,
	we will start this chapter by putting the above example into the
	world of today, i.e. the world of digital resources. &copy; 2008
