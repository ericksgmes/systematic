	from multiple vendors run into interoperability barriers. Systems
	of integrated medical devices support improvements in workflow and
	reductions in medical errors and healthcare costs to the benefit
	of patients throughout the continuum of care. Methods: Interoperability
	is achieved using a middleware for ubiquitous computing based on
	a service-oriented architecture. Connected devices provide services
	that can be composed dynamically to achieve extended functionality.
	We created a dynamic service composition system that generates high-level
	services based on the information the user provides using natural
	language. The system finds required devices based on a type of semantic
	distance between words and device descriptions and establishes connections
	between devices in order to satisfy the request. Results: One application
	of this approach is an intelligent surgical service where the medical
	doctor uses his voice to control a surgery robot. This scenario is
	experimented by asking the system to compose a service according
	to a medical doctor’s request during an appendectomy. Conclusion:
	Combining device functionality in order to satisfy a need expressed
	using a verbal request can be achieved by linking the semantics of
	the request to the computer understanding of a device. Interacting
	with medical equipment through the services they provide as plug-and-play
	devices is not limited to service composition, but also allows prototyping
	and simulation of various medical scenarios.},
